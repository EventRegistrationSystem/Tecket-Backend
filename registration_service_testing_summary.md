# Registration Service Update & Testing Summary

This document summarizes the work done to update the `RegistrationService` to handle conditional status based on event type (free vs. paid) and the subsequent unit testing process.

## 1. Initial Goal

The primary goal was to modify the `RegistrationService.registerForEvent` method so that:
*   Registrations for **free** events are created with a status of `CONFIRMED`.
*   Registrations for **paid** events are created with a status of `PENDING` (as payment processing is not yet implemented).

Following this change, comprehensive unit tests were needed to verify the new logic and ensure existing functionality remained correct.

## 2. Steps Taken

1.  **Modified Service Logic:** Updated `src/services/registrationServices.ts` within the `registerForEvent` function's transaction block to set the `status` field conditionally based on `event.isFree`.
2.  **Checked for Existing Test File:** Used `list_files` to check if `src/__tests__/unit/registrationService.test.ts` already existed. It did not.
3.  **Created Unit Test File:** Created `src/__tests__/unit/registrationService.test.ts` using `write_to_file`. This included:
    *   Mocking the Prisma client and its methods (`$transaction`, `event.findUnique`, `registration.create`, etc.).
    *   Setting up `beforeEach` to clear mocks.
    *   Defining mock data for free events, paid events, participants, and registration inputs.
    *   Writing test suites (`describe`) and individual test cases (`it`) for:
        *   `registerForEvent`: Covering successful free/paid registrations (checking status), validation errors (event full, ticket issues, missing question responses).
        *   `getRegistrations`: Covering retrieval and authorization logic for different user roles (Admin, Organizer, Participant) and filters.
        *   `getRegistrationById`: Covering retrieval and authorization logic.
4.  **Initial Test Execution:** Ran the tests using `npx jest src/__tests__/unit/registrationService.test.ts`.

## 3. Issues Encountered & Resolutions

The initial test run revealed several failures:

1.  **Issue:** TypeScript errors in `registrationService.test.ts`:
    *   `'result' is possibly 'null'`: The test assumed the final `findUnique` in the transaction always returned data.
    *   `'email' does not exist in type 'JwtPayload'`: Mock `JwtPayload` objects incorrectly included an `email` property.
    *   **Resolution:** Applied non-null assertions (`!`) where appropriate for the `result` variable and removed the `email` property from the mock `JwtPayload` objects using `replace_in_file`.
2.  **Issue:** Service logic bug in `registrationServices.ts`:
    *   The `event.tickets.find(ticket => { ticket.id === registrationData.ticketId })` used curly braces, causing it to return `undefined` instead of filtering. This led to "Ticket not found" errors during tests for paid events.
    *   **Resolution:** Corrected the arrow function syntax to `event.tickets.find(ticket => ticket.id === registrationData.ticketId)` using `replace_in_file`.
3.  **Issue:** Incorrect `$transaction` mock in `registrationService.test.ts`:
    *   The mock only handled the callback pattern (`async (callback) => callback(prisma)`), failing for the array pattern (`[findManyPromise, countPromise]`) used in `getRegistrations`. This caused `TypeError: callback is not a function`.
    *   **Resolution:** Updated the mock implementation for `$transaction` to detect the argument type (function or array) and handle both patterns correctly using `replace_in_file`.
4.  **Issue:** Test setup cleanup error in `src/__tests__/setup.ts`:
    *   The `afterAll` hook attempted to delete `User` records before related `Event` records, violating the `organiserId` foreign key constraint.
    *   **Resolution:** Reordered the `deleteMany()` calls in `afterAll` to respect dependencies (deleting dependent records first) using `replace_in_file`.
5.  **Issue:** Mock data type mismatch (`number` vs. `Decimal`):
    *   The test mock data used plain numbers for `ticket.price`, while the service code expected a Prisma `Decimal` and called `.toNumber()`. This caused `TypeError: ticket.price.toNumber is not a function`.
    *   **Initial Incorrect Fix:** Removed `.toNumber()` from the service. This caused a TypeScript error because the actual Prisma type *is* `Decimal`.
    *   **Correct Resolution:** Reverted the service code change (re-added `.toNumber()`) and updated the mock data in `registrationService.test.ts` to simulate the `Decimal` object by providing `price: { toNumber: () => 50.00 }` using `replace_in_file`.

## 4. Final Result

After applying all fixes, the command `npx jest src/__tests__/unit/registrationService.test.ts` was executed again, and **all 21 tests passed**.

This confirms that the `RegistrationService` now correctly assigns `CONFIRMED` or `PENDING` status based on the event type and that the core registration and retrieval logic functions as expected according to the unit tests.
