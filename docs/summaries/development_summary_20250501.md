# Development Summary (as of 2025-05-01)

This document summarizes the recent development work focused on integrating Stripe payments and refactoring the registration system to handle multiple participants per registration.

## 1. Stripe Payment Backend Setup (Test Mode)

The foundational backend components required to process payments using Stripe Payment Intents have been implemented.

**Changes & New Implementations:**

*   **Dependencies:** Added `stripe` and `@types/stripe` npm packages.
*   **Configuration:** Added `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to `.env.example`.
*   **Database (`prisma/schema.prisma`):**
    *   Modified the existing `Payment` model to include `stripePaymentIntentId` (String, unique) and `currency` (String).
    *   Applied migration `20250423233534_add_stripe_payment_fields`.
*   **Types (`src/types/paymentTypes.ts`):** Created DTOs for payment intent creation (`CreatePaymentIntentDto`, `CreatePaymentIntentResponse`) and a basic type for Stripe webhook events (`StripeWebhookEvent`).
*   **Service (`src/services/paymentServices.ts`):**
    *   Initialized Stripe Node.js client using the secret key.
    *   Implemented `createPaymentIntent`: Fetches registration/purchase, calculates amount, creates/retrieves Stripe PaymentIntent, saves payment record to DB, returns `client_secret`.
    *   Implemented `handleWebhookEvent`: Receives Stripe events, verifies signature (logic in controller), processes `payment_intent.succeeded` (updates `Payment` and `Registration` status) and `payment_intent.payment_failed` (updates `Payment` status). Includes basic idempotency checks.
*   **Controller (`src/controllers/paymentController.ts`):**
    *   Created `createPaymentIntentHandler`: Handles `POST /api/payments/create-intent` requests, calls service, returns response.
    *   Created `handleStripeWebhook`: Handles `POST /api/payments/webhook/stripe`, verifies webhook signature using `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent`, calls service, sends appropriate response to Stripe.
*   **Routes (`src/routes/paymentRoutes.ts`):** Defined routes for `/create-intent` (with `authenticate` middleware) and `/webhook/stripe`.
*   **App Integration (`src/app.ts`):**
    *   Imported payment routes and `handleStripeWebhook` controller.
    *   Mounted the webhook route (`/api/payments/webhook/stripe`) *before* the global `express.json()` middleware, applying `express.raw({ type: 'application/json' })` specifically to it.
    *   Mounted the remaining payment routes (`/api/payments`) *after* the global `express.json()` middleware.

## 2. Multi-Participant Registration Refactor

The registration system was refactored to align with the frontend requirement of collecting details for each individual attendee when multiple tickets are purchased in a single registration.

**Changes & New Implementations:**

*   **Database (`prisma/schema.prisma`):**
    *   Added a new `Attendee` model linking `Registration` and `Participant`. Includes `registrationId`, `participantId`, and a relation `responses Response[]`.
    *   Updated `Registration` model: Added `attendees Attendee[]` relation, removed direct `responses Response[]` relation.
    *   Updated `Participant` model: Added `attendees Attendee[]` relation.
    *   Updated `Response` model: Removed `registrationId`, added `attendeeId` and corresponding `attendee Attendee` relation.
    *   Applied migration `20250501092344_add_attendee_handling`.
    *   Regenerated Prisma Client (`npx prisma generate`).
*   **Types (`src/types/registrationTypes.ts`):**
    *   Replaced old `RegistrationDto` with:
        *   `ParticipantInput`: Structure for individual participant details including their specific `responses` array (`{ eventQuestionId, responseText }`).
        *   `CreateRegistrationDto`: Main DTO for `POST /api/registrations`, accepting `eventId`, optional `userId`, `tickets` array (`{ ticketId, quantity }`), and `participants` array (`ParticipantInput[]`).
        *   `CreateRegistrationResponse`: Defines the success response structure.
        *   `RegistrationDetailsDto`: Example DTO for retrieving detailed registration info (needs refinement).
*   **Service (`src/services/registrationServices.ts`):**
    *   Refactored `registerForEvent` (renamed to `createRegistration`) to accept `CreateRegistrationDto`.
    *   Updated logic within a transaction to:
        *   Perform pre-validations (input structure, event status/capacity, ticket validity).
        *   Validate participant responses (required questions answered, valid question IDs).
        *   Lock/re-validate ticket quantities within the transaction.
        *   Find/create the primary `Participant`.
        *   Create the main `Registration`.
        *   Loop through the `participants` array: find/create `Participant`, create `Attendee` linking `Registration` and `Participant`, create `Response` records linked to the new `Attendee`.
        *   Create `Purchase` record(s) (Note: Current implementation has a workaround assuming only one ticket *type* per registration due to schema limitations).
        *   Update `Ticket` quantities sold.
        *   Return `{ message, registrationId }`.
*   **Controller (`src/controllers/registrationController.ts`):**
    *   Updated `createRegistration` handler to use the new service method and DTO, passing `req.user.userId` if available. Temporarily commented out Joi validation pending schema update.
*   **Validation (`src/validation/registrationValidation.ts`):**
    *   Updated `registrationValidationSchema` (Joi) to match the `CreateRegistrationDto` structure, including nested validation for the `participants` array and their `responses`.

## 3. Shortcomings & TODOs

*   **TypeScript Errors:** Persistent TS errors were observed during development related to Stripe/Prisma imports and type recognition (e.g., `Attendee`, enums, `stripePaymentIntentId`). These likely require local environment troubleshooting (Restart TS Server, reinstall `node_modules`).
*   **Purchase Model Limitation:** The current `Purchase` model (1-to-1 with `Registration` and `Ticket`) does not properly support purchasing multiple *different types* of tickets within a single registration. The refactored `createRegistration` service includes a temporary workaround assuming only one ticket type. This needs revisiting if multi-type purchases are required.
*   **Validation Schema:** The Joi schema in `registrationValidation.ts` was updated, but the controller currently bypasses it (`TODO` added). It needs to be re-enabled and potentially refined (e.g., custom validation for matching participant count to ticket quantity).
*   **Authorization (`/create-intent`):** Authorization logic needs to be added to ensure the user requesting payment is allowed to pay for the specified `registrationId`.
*   **Testing:**
    *   No unit or integration tests have been written for the new payment module (`paymentServices`, `paymentController`).
    *   Unit tests for `registrationServices` need significant updates to cover the multi-attendee logic.
    *   End-to-end testing (including frontend interaction and webhook simulation via ngrok/Stripe CLI) is required for both registration and payment flows.
*   **Other Registration Methods:** `getRegistrations`, `getRegistrationById`, `cancelRegistration` service methods need updating to correctly fetch/display/handle data based on the new `Attendee` structure.
*   **Frontend Integration:** The corresponding frontend changes (using Stripe.js/Elements) outlined in `docs/payment_integration_plan.md` need to be implemented.
*   **Refunds:** Refund logic is not implemented.
*   **Free Events:** The multi-participant flow for free events needs clarification and potential adjustments in `registrationServices.ts`.
