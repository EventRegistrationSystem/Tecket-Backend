# Event Service - Unit Test Enhancement Summary

**Date:** 21/04/2025

## 1. Goal

The objective was to enhance the unit test coverage for the `EventService` (`src/services/eventServices.ts`) based on previously identified gaps in the test suite (`src/__tests__/unit/eventService.test.ts`). This involved adding tests for uncovered scenarios, edge cases, and error handling.

## 2. Steps Taken

1.  **Analysis:** Reviewed the existing tests in `src/__tests__/unit/eventService.test.ts` and compared them against the methods and logic within `src/services/eventServices.ts` and the requirements outlined in `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`. Identified several key areas lacking coverage.
2.  **Test Implementation (`src/__tests__/unit/eventService.test.ts`):** Added new test cases (`it` blocks) within the relevant `describe` blocks:
    *   **`createEvent`:**
        *   Added test for successfully creating a *free* event (ensuring no tickets are created).
        *   Added tests for validation errors: rejecting creation if the end date is before the start date, and rejecting if the start date is in the past.
    *   **`getAllEvents`:**
        *   Added tests to verify correct application of date filters (`startDate`, `endDate`).
        *   Added test for the location filter.
        *   Added test confirming the default status filter (`PUBLISHED`) for unauthenticated users.
        *   Added test for the `ADMIN` role (`adminView=true`) correctly removing the status filter.
        *   Added tests for the `ORGANIZER` role (`myEvents=true`) correctly showing all statuses for their own events and allowing status filtering when specified.
    *   **`updateEvent`:**
        *   Added test for date validation (rejecting if end date becomes earlier than start date).
        *   Added test for successfully changing a paid event to free *when no registrations exist* (verifying ticket deactivation).
        *   Added test for *rejecting* the change from paid to free *if registrations exist*.
        *   Added test for verifying the ticket update logic (delete existing unsold, create new) when a `tickets` array is provided for a paid event.
        *   Added test for handling updates to a non-existent event (throwing 'Event not found').
    *   **`updateEventStatus`:**
        *   Added test for rejecting publishing a *paid* event if it has no tickets.
        *   Added tests for rejecting invalid status transitions (e.g., `COMPLETED` to `PUBLISHED`, `CANCELLED` to `PUBLISHED`).
        *   Added test for successfully restoring a `CANCELLED` event to `DRAFT`.
        *   Added test for handling status updates on a non-existent event (throwing 'Event not found').
    *   **`getEventById`:**
        *   Added a new `describe` block.
        *   Added test for successfully retrieving an event and verifying the included registration count.
        *   Added test for handling non-existent events (throwing 'Event not found').
    *   **`getEventWithDetails`:**
        *   Added a new `describe` block.
        *   Added test for successfully retrieving an event with all its associated details (organizer, tickets, questions).
        *   Added test for handling non-existent events (throwing 'Event not found').
        *   *Note:* Corrected mock setup issues related to `EventService.getEventWithDetails` being mocked within `updateEvent` tests by ensuring mocks were properly cleared in `beforeEach`.
    *   **`deleteEvent`:**
        *   Added test for handling deletion attempts on a non-existent event (throwing 'Event not found').
3.  **Bug Fix (`src/services/eventServices.ts`):**
    *   Identified and fixed a bug in the `getAllEvents` method where the `isFree` filter was only applied if its value was `true`. The condition `if (filters.isFree)` was changed to `if (filters.isFree !== undefined)` to correctly handle cases where the filter should be applied for `isFree: false`.
4.  **Test Execution & Refinement:**
    *   Ran the test suite (`npx jest src/__tests__/unit/eventService.test.ts`) iteratively.
    *   Addressed initial test failures caused by mock initialization order (`ReferenceError: Cannot access 'mockPrisma' before initialization`) by restructuring the mock definition within the `jest.mock` factory function.
    *   Corrected failing test assertions based on test output and re-examination of service logic (specifically for `getAllEvents` filter checks and `updateEvent` question deletion logic).

## 3. Final Result

After implementing the new test cases and applying the necessary bug fix and test corrections, the command `npx jest src/__tests__/unit/eventService.test.ts` was executed, and **all 43 tests passed**.

This significantly improves the unit test coverage for the `EventService`, increasing confidence in its various functionalities and edge case handling.
